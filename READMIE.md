I'm a junior Data Analyst joining tech about two years ago. Working on four different projects, this is some technology I have worked with(R, Python, SQL, Tableau, Data Visualization and machine-learned). I will be glad 'if I see some senior Data analysts collaborate work with me', am currently learning java programming.
